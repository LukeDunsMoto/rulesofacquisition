## About the Game

*Rules of Acquisition* is a greedy, cunning, and fully tongue-in-cheek strategy game where you play as an up-and-coming Ferengi in a volatile galactic economy. With each turn, you’ll draw from the legendary (and often legally questionable) **Rules of Acquisition**, perform bold actions, and manipulate five major factions — all in the name of glorious profit.

Inspired by Ferengi lore from Star Trek, the game features a mix of canonical and parody Rules, dynamic sector events, and a reputation system that remembers *every* bribe.
